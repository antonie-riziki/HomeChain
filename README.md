Decentralized Domestic Work Platform

## Overview
This platform connects domestic workers (nannies, housekeepers, caregivers, etc.) with employers through a secure, transparent, and intelligent system. 

The platform combines:
- Off-chain job discovery and skill development
- On-chain smart contract agreements
- Escrow-based payment protection
- AI-powered job matching and salary prediction
- Credit scoring and safety mechanisms

## Problem

Daily domestic workers rely heavily on:
- Word-of-mouth referrals
- Informal networks
- Physical “tarmacking” to find opportunities
- Unstructured agreements with no legal or financial protection

This results in:
- Job insecurity
- Wage exploitation
- Lack of career growth
- No verified work history
- Safety risks for both parties

---

## Solution

We provide a hybrid decentralized platform that:

1. Allows employers to post detailed domestic job opportunities.
2. Matches employees based on skills, distance, availability, and ratings.
3. Provides skill recognition and upskilling programs off-chain.
4. Generates a smart contract agreement on-chain.
5. Uses escrow-like wallets to secure payments.
6. Predicts fair salary using AI (location, distance, skills, demand).
7. Tracks work verification from both parties before releasing funds.
