# 🧠 Overview

HomeChain is a hybrid decentralized platform connecting domestic workers
(nannies, housekeepers, caregivers, cooks, drivers) with employers
through secure smart contract agreements on the **Stellar blockchain**.

We combine:

- 🔗 On-chain escrow smart contracts (Soroban)
- 🤖 AI-powered job matching & salary prediction
- 📊 Credit scoring & trust metrics
- 🔐 Identity verification & dispute handling
- 💸 Secure payment release logic

---

# ❗ The Problem

Domestic workers face:

- Informal job sourcing ("tarmacking")
- Wage exploitation
- No enforceable agreements
- No verified work history
- Safety risks
- No financial credibility

Employers face:

- Trust issues
- No verified worker background
- Payment disputes
- No structured contracts

# 💡 The Solution

### 1️⃣ Job Posting (Off-chain)
Employers post detailed domestic job opportunities.

### 2️⃣ AI Matching
Workers matched by:
- Skills
- Location
- Availability
- Ratings
- Demand index

### 3️⃣ Smart Contract Generation (On-chain)
Soroban contract auto-generates agreement terms:
- Job duration
- Payment terms
- Work verification triggers
- Escrow rules

### 4️⃣ Escrow Protection
Funds locked in Stellar-based escrow until:
- Worker confirms completion
- Employer verifies work

### 5️⃣ Automated Release
Dual confirmation triggers on-chain payment release.
